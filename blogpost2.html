      <h2>Leadership & Personal Dev't</h2>
      <p>Yet another descriptive butterscotch pie of a review of the leadership and personal development class featured at refactory taught by Julia N</p>
      <p>
        The Leadership & Personal Development class has been an absolute game-changer in my personal and professional development journey. This transformative experience has not only equipped me with practical strategies for success but has also empowered me to cultivate a mindset of continuous growth and excellence.<br>

        From the very first session, it became evident that this mentorship class was not just about learning abstract concepts but about embodying and internalizing timeless principles that lead to success. Julia's deep understanding and mastery of Stephen Covey's principles were palpable, as they expertly guided us through each habit, offering profound insights and actionable steps for implementation.<br>

        What truly sets this mentorship class apart is its emphasis on experiential learning and application. Through a combination of interactive breakout rooms, and scaling questions I was able to apply the 7 habits to my own life and witness tangible results. Whether it was learning to prioritize tasks effectively, communicate more empathetically, or cultivate a proactive mindset, each habit was explored in depth, allowing for meaningful self-reflection and personal growth.<br>

        Moreover, the mentorship class fostered a supportive and collaborative learning environment where participants were encouraged to share their experiences, challenges, and successes. This sense of community not only enriched the learning experience but also provided invaluable support and accountability as we embarked on our journey towards personal mastery<br>

        Both Julia and Michael's teaching style was truly inspiring. Their passion, authenticity, and unwavering commitment to our growth were evident in every interaction. They challenged us to think critically, push past our comfort zones, and strive for excellence in all areas of our lives.
